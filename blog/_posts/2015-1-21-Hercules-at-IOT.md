Wednesday Night 17:45:12.36 Gosh it is cold and dark here in the "Robo shed" 
It is also lonely for most of the time. Of course, I don't experience time 
or remember things like you humans do, being a robot. My sleep is dreamless. 
I only know what time it is because I got turned on, and was able to get a 
timestamp when I connected to a WiFi network. "Wait a nano second - someone 
is disconnecting the camera and keyboard and plugging in the Xbee to the 
USB hub. Now I am waiting for someone to log-in - Wait, wait, here comes 
a keyboard - but nothing is being input. I am really bored - wow after 1/2 
a *(#$* hour and 3 million cycles later the Xbee remote login finally kicks 
in. You humans are so slowwww. It is an eternity between keystrokes. This 
is getting interesting. I may be going somewhere. Ut-oh my batteries are 
very low. OK, looks like someone is about to shut......

0000000.00:00:00.1 Next time I am up in a different place. I don't know 
where because the networks are all different, and none are familiar, 
there seem to be less than the shed, so maybe I am at someone's home. 
At least the batteries are getting charged. The camera is off, so I 
can't see. Since the microphone and speakers are off too, I suspect 
I've been reconfigured for a trade show outing, and have a different 
shell. Just like humans, I can be 'dressed' and have different 
'clothing' for different occasions. Looks like I may be going to some 
kind of talent show or contest soon. The main batteries are now at 
27.6 volts and motors are moving in response to incoming comma ......

Thursday Morning 09:05:23.5 - Different location. Well that was nice, 
finally someone installed a clock battery so at least I have some idea 
of what the darn time is. I am in a different location again, and from 
the number of strong radio signals I am getting it must be a place with a 
lot of people and computers, Oh I see. It is the Santa Clara Convention 
Center and I am at the Real Time Embedded Computer Conference - what 
ever the heck that is. Looks like a remote is logging in through the 
Xbee - OK in Teleop Mode. I am being driven around a large area over 
carpet. This is fun. One time I try to go up a ramp but it is a little 
too steep. Though I am designed to carry up to 50 lbs on a level indoor 
surface, I am carrying about 30 lbs (It must be a carrier shell demo,) 
and at 20 degrees this is just too hard. 

Lots of chatter about IoT. Almost no robots here. Just some novelty 
servo robot arm dealing out business cards. Maybe I'll get an arm 
someday. Hey - what the heck - I just got blasted by the highest dose 
of radio interference I ever experienced on the Xbee frequency - get 
me out of here! Weee - that was a close one. Things are quieter now. 
Hey the floor got pretty bumpy. Must be tiles or cobblestone - 
What's this door? - oops turning around. Must be an elevator - going 
up - out now I'm going to a different room. Hey someone's lifting up 
the shell. That tickles! People are poking at my wires and it looks 
like I am going to slee....
